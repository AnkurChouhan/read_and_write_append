# Assignment 4: Files, Exceptions, and Errors

## Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors

This script (`read_file.py`) opens and reads a file named `sample.txt` line by line.  
If the file does not exist, it handles the error gracefully with a user-friendly message.

## Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File
1. Takes input from the user and writes it to `output.txt`.
2. Appends more user input to the same file.
3. Reads and displays the final contents of the file.
